## Steps to Run the Flask Backend with Frontend

Follow these steps to set up and run the Flask backend with an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv tts-env
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- **Windows**:  
  ```bash
  tts-env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:  
  ```bash
  source tts-env/bin/activate
  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file that contains all necessary dependencies. Install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask Application
Execute the following command to start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```
If your `app.py` specifies a different entry point, modify the command accordingly.

### 4. Access the Web Application
Once the Flask server is running, open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```
(Default Flask port is `5000`, but modify accordingly if a different port is set in `app.py`.)


### 5. Stop the Server
To stop the Flask server, use `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

Your Flask backend should now be running successfully with the frontend!

---
If you face any issues, ensure:
- Python and Flask are installed correctly.
- The correct virtual environment is activated.
- Dependencies are installed properly.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
